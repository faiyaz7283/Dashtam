# Documentation Organization Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Root Directory (15 .md files - Too cluttered!)
```
./ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
./ASYNC_TESTING_RESEARCH.md
./ENVIRONMENT_FLOWS.md
./INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md
./INFRASTRUCTURE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
./PHASE_3_HANDOFF.md
./PHASE_3_PROGRESS.md
./README.md                      # Keep
./TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md
./TESTING_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
./TESTING_STRATEGY.md
./WARP.md                        # Keep
./docs/ENV_FILE_ISSUE_FIX.md
./docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md
./tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

---

## Proposed Organization Structure

### 1. **Root Directory** (Essential Only)
Keep only the most critical, frequently accessed documents:
```
README.md                    # Project overview, quick start
WARP.md                      # AI agent rules and project context
CONTRIBUTING.md              # How to contribute (create if needed)
```

### 2. **`docs/` - User-Facing Documentation**
For end users, API consumers, and application usage:
```
docs/
├── README.md                # Index of all documentation
├── api/
│   ├── authentication.md    # API authentication guide
│   ├── providers.md         # Provider endpoints
│   └── webhooks.md          # Webhook documentation
├── setup/
│   ├── installation.md      # Installation guide
│   ├── configuration.md     # Configuration options
│   └── env-variables.md     # Environment variables
└── guides/
    ├── oauth-flow.md        # OAuth integration guide
    └── troubleshooting.md   # Common issues
```

### 3. **`docs/development/` - Developer Documentation**
For developers working ON the project:
```
docs/development/
├── README.md                # Development docs index
├── architecture/
│   ├── overview.md          # FROM: ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
│   ├── database-schema.md   # Database design
│   └── api-design.md        # API design decisions
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── docker-setup.md      # FROM: INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md
│   ├── environment-flows.md # FROM: ENVIRONMENT_FLOWS.md
│   └── ci-cd.md             # FROM: docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md
├── testing/
│   ├── README.md            # Testing overview
│   ├── strategy.md          # FROM: TESTING_STRATEGY.md
│   ├── guide.md             # FROM: tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md
│   └── migration.md         # FROM: TESTING_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
└── guides/
    ├── adding-providers.md  # How to add new providers
    └── database-migrations.md
```

### 4. **`docs/research/` - Research & Decision Records**
Historical research, decisions, and migration notes:
```
docs/research/
├── README.md                    # Research docs index
├── async-testing.md             # FROM: ASYNC_TESTING_RESEARCH.md
├── infrastructure-migration.md  # FROM: INFRASTRUCTURE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
├── test-coverage-plan.md        # FROM: TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md
└── archived/
    ├── phase-3-handoff.md       # FROM: PHASE_3_HANDOFF.md
    ├── phase-3-progress.md      # FROM: PHASE_3_PROGRESS.md
    └── env-file-fix.md          # FROM: docs/ENV_FILE_ISSUE_FIX.md
```

### 5. **`tests/` - Test Documentation**
```
tests/
├── TESTING_GUIDE.md         # Already here, keep it
└── README.md                # Create: Quick testing guide
```

---

## Reorganization Actions

### Step 1: Create New Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p docs/development/{architecture,infrastructure,testing,guides}
mkdir -p docs/research/archived
mkdir -p docs/setup
mkdir -p docs/api
mkdir -p docs/guides
```

### Step 2: Move & Rename Files

#### To `docs/development/architecture/`
```bash
mv ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md docs/development/architecture/overview.md
```

#### To `docs/development/infrastructure/`
```bash
mv INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md docs/development/infrastructure/docker-setup.md
mv ENVIRONMENT_FLOWS.md docs/development/infrastructure/environment-flows.md
mv docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md docs/development/infrastructure/ci-cd.md
```

#### To `docs/development/testing/`
```bash
mv TESTING_STRATEGY.md docs/development/testing/strategy.md
mv TESTING_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md docs/development/testing/migration.md
cp tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md docs/development/testing/guide.md  # Keep original in tests/
```

#### To `docs/research/`
```bash
mv ASYNC_TESTING_RESEARCH.md docs/research/async-testing.md
mv INFRASTRUCTURE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md docs/research/infrastructure-migration.md
mv TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md docs/research/test-coverage-plan.md
```

#### To `docs/research/archived/`
```bash
mv PHASE_3_HANDOFF.md docs/research/archived/phase-3-handoff.md
mv PHASE_3_PROGRESS.md docs/research/archived/phase-3-progress.md
mv docs/ENV_FILE_ISSUE_FIX.md docs/research/archived/env-file-fix.md
```

### Step 3: Create Index Files

Create `docs/README.md`:
```markdown
# Dashtam Documentation

## For Users
- [Installation Guide](setup/installation.md)
- [Configuration](setup/configuration.md)
- [API Documentation](api/)
- [Troubleshooting](guides/troubleshooting.md)

## For Developers
- [Development Guide](development/)
- [Architecture Overview](development/architecture/overview.md)
- [Testing Guide](development/testing/)
- [Infrastructure Setup](development/infrastructure/)

## Research & Decisions
- [Research Notes](research/)
- [Archived Docs](research/archived/)
```

Create `docs/development/README.md`:
```markdown
# Development Documentation

## Architecture
- [System Overview](architecture/overview.md)
- [Database Schema](architecture/database-schema.md)
- [API Design](architecture/api-design.md)

## Infrastructure
- [Docker Setup](infrastructure/docker-setup.md)
- [Environment Flows](infrastructure/environment-flows.md)
- [CI/CD Pipeline](infrastructure/ci-cd.md)

## Testing
- [Testing Strategy](testing/strategy.md)
- [Testing Guide](testing/guide.md)
- [Migration Summary](testing/migration.md)

## Guides
- [Adding Providers](guides/adding-providers.md)
- [Database Migrations](guides/database-migrations.md)
```

### Step 4: Update README.md Links
Update root README.md to point to new locations.

## Benefits of This Structure

### ✅ Clear Separation
- **Root**: Only essential files
- **docs/**: User-facing documentation
- **docs/development/**: Developer documentation
- **docs/research/**: Historical research & decisions

### ✅ Discoverability
- Logical grouping by topic
- Index files in each major directory
- Clear naming conventions

### ✅ Maintainability
- Easy to find and update docs
- Clear place for new documentation
- Archived docs don't clutter main areas

### ✅ Standard Conventions
- Follows common open-source patterns
- Similar to projects like FastAPI, Django, etc.
- Easy for new contributors to navigate

---

## Documents to Keep vs Archive

### ✅ Keep (Active Reference)
- `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` → `docs/development/testing/strategy.md`
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` → Keep in tests/, copy to docs/development/testing/
- `TESTING_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/development/testing/migration.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` → `docs/development/architecture/overview.md`
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md` → `docs/development/infrastructure/docker-setup.md`
- `ENVIRONMENT_FLOWS.md` → `docs/development/infrastructure/environment-flows.md`

### 📦 Archive (Historical Reference)
- `PHASE_3_HANDOFF.md` → `docs/research/archived/`
- `PHASE_3_PROGRESS.md` → `docs/research/archived/`
- `ENV_FILE_ISSUE_FIX.md` → `docs/research/archived/`

### 🗑️ Can Delete (Superseded/Redundant)
- None - Keep all for historical context

### 📚 Research (Decision Records)
- `ASYNC_TESTING_RESEARCH.md` → `docs/research/async-testing.md`
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` → `docs/research/infrastructure-migration.md`
- `TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md` → `docs/research/test-coverage-plan.md`

## Implementation Script

I can create a bash script to execute all these moves automatically, or we can do it step by step. What's your preference?

Would you like me to:
1. ✅ Create the script and run it automatically
2. ⏸️ Show you the commands first for review
3. 🛠️ Do it step-by-step with your approval at each stage
