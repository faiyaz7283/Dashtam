## 🗂️ When to Archive

Move documents to `archived/` when:
- ✅ The research has led to implementation
- ✅ The migration is complete
- ✅ The document is historical reference only
- ✅ The information is captured in active documentation

Keep documents active when:
- ⏳ Research is ongoing
- ⏳ Decision is being implemented
- ⏳ Future reference is needed for similar work
