# GitHub Actions CI/CD - Setup Complete ✅

## 🎉 Status: Fully Operational

**Last Updated**: Phase 2 CI/CD Complete

### Implemented Components

The following are fully configured and operational:

- ✅ `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Main CI/CD workflow
- ✅ `docker-compose.ci.yml` - CI environment configuration  
- ✅ `.env.ci.example` - CI environment variables template
- ✅ `.env.ci` - Actual CI environment file
- ✅ `codecov.yml` - Codecov configuration with thresholds
- ✅ Docker Compose v2 migration complete
- ✅ Branch protection enabled on `development` branch
- ✅ Codecov integration with automated uploads
- ✅ All 39 tests passing in CI

## 🎯 Current Workflow Status

### Active Workflows

**Test Suite Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to `main`, `development`, `develop` branches
- **Jobs**: 2 parallel jobs
  1. **Test Suite**: Runs all 39 tests in Docker
  2. **Code Quality**: Lints code with ruff
- **Status**: ✅ All checks passing
- **Coverage**: 51% uploaded to Codecov

### Workflow Steps

**Test Job**:
1. Checkout code
2. Build Docker images (docker-compose.ci.yml)
3. Wait for services (postgres, redis) health checks
4. Run test suite with coverage
5. Upload coverage reports (XML, HTML) as artifacts
6. Upload coverage to Codecov

**Lint Job**:
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Python 3.13
3. Install dependencies (ruff)
4. Run linting checks
5. Report results

---

## 🔍 What Happens Automatically

When you push code, GitHub Actions will:

1. **Detect the workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
2. **Spin up Ubuntu runner** (free, provided by GitHub)
3. **Run two jobs in parallel:**
   - **Test Job:** Build and run full test suite via `docker-compose.ci.yml`
   - **Lint Job:** Check code quality with ruff
4. **Report results:**
   - ✅ Green checkmark if all pass
   - ❌ Red X if anything fails
   - 📊 Detailed logs for debugging

---

## 🎯 Triggers

Your workflow runs automatically on:

✅ **Push to `main` branch**
✅ **Push to `develop` branch**  
✅ **Pull requests to `main` or `develop`**

You can customize triggers in `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, feature/* ]  # Add more branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
```

## 🛡️ Branch Protection - ✅ ENABLED

**Status**: Active on `development` branch

### Current Protection Rules

**Protected Branch**: `development`

**Required Status Checks**:
- ✅ `Test Suite / Run Tests` - Must pass
- ✅ `Code Quality / lint` - Must pass
- ✅ Branches must be up to date before merging

**Pull Request Reviews**:
- ✅ At least 1 approval required
- ✅ Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- ✅ Require conversation resolution

**Restrictions**:
- ✅ No direct commits (PRs required)
- ✅ No force pushes
- ✅ No branch deletion

### To Protect Additional Branches

1. Go to repo **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule**
3. Branch name pattern: `main` (or other branch)
4. Enable same settings as `development`
5. Save changes

## 📊 Codecov Integration - ✅ OPERATIONAL

**Status**: Fully configured and active

### Current Configuration

**What's Set Up**:
- ✅ Codecov account connected to repository
- ✅ `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret configured in GitHub Actions
- ✅ `codecov.yml` configuration file with custom settings
- ✅ Automated coverage uploads on every CI run
- ✅ Coverage badge in README.md
- ✅ Current coverage: **51%**

**Codecov Configuration** (`codecov.yml`):
```yaml
coverage:
  status:
    project:
      default:
        target: 85%          # Target overall coverage
        threshold: 2%        # Allow 2% drop without failing
    patch:
      default:
        target: 80%          # New code should be 80%+ tested
        threshold: 5%
```

**Coverage by Component**:
- API Layer: 90% (Provider endpoints)
- Models: 73-83% (Database models)
- Services: 12-72% (Variable, needs expansion)
- Providers: 30-79% (Provider implementations)

### How It Works

1. **CI runs tests** with coverage enabled
2. **Coverage reports generated** (XML and HTML formats)
3. **Uploaded to Codecov** using `codecov/codecov-action@v5`
4. **Codecov analyzes** and provides insights
5. **PR comments** show coverage changes (if configured)
6. **Badge updates** automatically in README

### Viewing Coverage Reports

**On Codecov Dashboard**:
- Visit: https://codecov.io/gh/faiyaz7283/Dashtam
- View file-by-file coverage
- Track coverage trends over time
- See which lines are tested/untested

**In CI Artifacts**:
- Go to GitHub Actions → Workflow run
- Download "test-results" artifact
- Contains `htmlcov/` folder with detailed HTML reports

### Coverage Goals

**Current**: 51% (39 tests)
**Phase 2 Target**: 85%+ overall

**Priority Areas for Coverage Expansion**:
1. Token Service (currently 12%)
2. Auth Endpoints (currently 19%)
3. Schwab Provider (currently 30%)
4. Database utilities (currently 47%)

## 🧪 Local Testing (Before Pushing)

Test your CI locally before pushing:

```bash
# Run exactly what GitHub Actions will run
make ci-test

# If it passes locally, it will pass in GitHub Actions!
```

---

## 📈 Viewing Results

### In GitHub:

**Actions Tab:**
- See all workflow runs
- Click on a run to see detailed logs
- Download artifacts (coverage reports)

**Pull Requests:**
- Status checks show at bottom of PR
- Required checks must pass before merge

**README Badge (Optional):**

Add to your README.md:

```markdown
![Tests](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Dashtam/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running?

1. **Check file location:** Must be `.github/workflows/test.yml`
2. **Check YAML syntax:** Indentation matters!
3. **Check GitHub Actions is enabled:** Repo Settings → Actions

### Tests Failing in CI but Pass Locally?

1. **Check .env.ci file:** Make sure it's committed
2. **Check Docker cache:** CI rebuilds from scratch
3. **Check logs:** Actions tab → Click failed run → View logs

### Need Help?

1. Check [GitHub Actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
2. View workflow logs in Actions tab
3. Run `make ci-test` locally to debug
